Developed a deep learning project in the field of agriculture. My goal was to create a simple image classification model that categorized Potato Leaf Disease using a straightforward convolutional neural network architecture. Began by collecting the necessary data, and then I built models to interpret and explain it

Potato growers sometimes suffer significant annual financial losses as a result of several illnesses that impact potato plants. The two most prevalent diseases are Early and Late Blight. Fungal infections are the cause of early blight, whereas some microorganisms are the source of late blight. Farmers can avoid financial loss and salvage a significant amount of crop output if they identify this illness early and treat it appropriately. It is crucial to accurately identify the type of disease affecting your potato plant, as there are distinct treatments for early and late blight. Convolutional Neural Network - Deep Learning will be used in the background to identify plant illnesses.
